            <p>Our   program is going to save restaurants money due to the vast amount of   deviations and our locked margin schedule. We have a history of   providing an average of 10% savings for our members. If you provide us   with current invoices we will simply plug those purchases into our cost   savings program and see if there is any money to be saved.</p>

            <p>Our   membership program provides a communication platform that will allow   restaurant operators to speak with other like-minded professionals   without sharing trade secrets with competitors. We give you a team   outside of your restaurant to help you source and share innovative ideas   and provide industry knowledge. As an example, The Restaurant Society   is able to connect a high-end pizza restaurant in New York with a   high-end pizza restaurant in California.</p>
